    -> branch_self_confident
* [Sleep is overrated when the night calls.]
    -> branch_rebellious

    -> branch_poetic

=== branch_self_confident ===
Lyra: \(Smiling\) Confident, aren’t we? But confidence without caution can be dangerous.

* [I’m prepared for any challenge.]
    -> prepared_path
* [Perhaps I should temper my pride with a bit of caution.]
    -> humble_path

=== branch_rebellious ===

Darius: Sharpening my blade is different. A dull sword can't protect anyone.
* [I thrive in the chaos of the night.]

* [Maybe I can learn to harness both chaos and order.]
    -> balanced_path

=== branch_poetic ===
Lyra: \(Laughing softly\) Poetic, but even the stars need rest.
Darius: Sharpening my blade is different. A dull sword can't protect anyone.
* [Then I'll forge a destiny as vibrant as a sunrise.]
    -> art_path
* [But sometimes the beauty of the night masks my weariness.]
    -> fatigue_path

=== prepared_path ===
Lyra: \(Nodding\) Preparedness is admirable, yet even the strongest sword can lose its edge without rest.
Darius: \(Determined\) I’ll keep my edge sharp, no matter what.
-> END

=== humble_path ===
Lyra: \(Softly\) Humility can be as vital as strength; maybe a little rest is in order.
Darius: \(Resigned\) Perhaps you're right, a moment of pause wouldn't hurt.
-> END

=== dark_path ===
Lyra: \(Cautiously\) The night may sharpen you, but its shadows can also cloud judgment.
Darius: \(Defiant\) I walk in the dark, trusting my instincts.
-> END

=== balanced_path ===
Lyra: \(Thoughtfully\) Balance is key. Embrace both the chaos and the calm.
Darius: \(Contemplative\) Maybe the true art is in finding that equilibrium.
-> END

=== art_path ===
Lyra: \(Intrigued\) A destiny painted with passion and fire—just be sure not to burn out.
Darius: \(Inspired\) I’ll let both art and steel guide my way.
-> END

=== fatigue_path ===
Lyra: \(Worried\) Fatigue can be a silent enemy, even for the most resolute.
Darius: \(Quietly\) Perhaps the beauty of the night is a lullaby urging me to rest.
-> END
